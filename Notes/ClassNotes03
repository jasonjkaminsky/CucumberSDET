Class 3 -

-- recap --
    -- architecture of framework --
    -- utils - to keep all the utilities of our project such as constants, config reader
                common methods etc to reuse them.


    -- steps - all step definitions can be found under this package for the gherkin
    steps we used in feature file
    -- Pages -- POM -- to implement object repository and functions.

    Runner class - we use this class to execute all of our test cases

For pre condition and post condition in cucumber we have 2 annotations

Hooks -
@Before - this one we use for pre condition
@After - this one we use for post condition


-- hooks should always be mentioned under steps package


Background vs hooks

Hooks are applicable to all feature files
Background is applicable to just one feature file\

Hooks execute first then background executes then scenario executes and in the
end hooks executes again as post condition
