-- Cucumbers encourages code re-usability concept

main - the code we write to develop the application, we write under main

1. develop the application
2. to test the application

test - the code we write to test the application, we write under test

2 things we have in every project

- coding - java
- non - java - properties file, excel etc.

coding will be at one place
non java will be at another place

-- to write gherkin scenarios, we use feature files

Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

scenario - every scenario is considered as one Test case

why we don't need system.setproperty() - "driver/chromedriver.exe"
if the path is incorrect to webdriver - it will fail is limited to one machine
many time it is not compatible with browser

we use webdrivermanager from now onwards
